-click on a video makes it the active one. this makes it so you can apply commands to it. after selecting u can : 
p = play the selected clip
r = reset the clip
s = stop the clip
k = opens the keyframe editor, 
   (from within this context) 
   a = add new keyframe
   d = remove last keyframe
   (changing the sliders changes the time selection of the clip)


shift + D = Duplicate the selected video

finally, the most fun thing so far is the connections between clips. 
double click on one clip, 
then
double click on the clip it should connect to. 

this will set up a sequence such that clip a plays, then b. 

you can build loops this way, by connecting a -> b -> c, then have c connect back to a!
this will play constantly. you can also have multiple clips off of one clip triggered. 
you can remove connections between clips by clicking on the line and pressing x
k toggles the keyframe editor display different keyframes on different clips
